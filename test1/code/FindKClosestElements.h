* 658. Find K Closest Elements

Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array. 
The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:

|a - x| < |b - x|, or
|a - x| == |b - x| and a < b

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
Output: [1,2,3,4]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
Output: [1,2,3,4]

Constraints:
1 <= k <= arr.length
1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
arr is sorted in ascending order.
-10^4 <= arr[i], x <= 10^4

In this implementation:
- We use a max heap to store pairs of the absolute difference between each element and *x*, along with the actual element value.
- We maintain the heap size to be *k* by popping the largest element whenever the size exceeds *k*.
- Finally, we extract the elements from the heap and sort them to get the result in ascending order.

1. **Time Complexity**:
In this implementation:
- We use a max heap to store pairs of the absolute difference between each element and *x*, along with the actual element value.
- We maintain the heap size to be *k* by popping the largest element whenever the size exceeds *k*.
- Finally, we extract the elements from the heap and sort them to get the result in ascending order.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - We use a max heap (priority queue) to store at most *k* elements; we also utilize a vector for the k elements.
   Therefore, the space complexity is *O(k)*.

In summary:
- Time complexity: *O(n log k)*
- Space complexity: *O(k)*
