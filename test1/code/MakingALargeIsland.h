	827. Making A Large Island

	You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.

	Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.

	An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.



	Example 1:

	Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
	Output: 3
	Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.
	Example 2:

	Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.
	Example 3:

	Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.


	Constraints:

	n == grid.length
	n == grid[i].length
	1 <= n <= 500
	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

Solution

Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the code without focusing on complexity.

1. **Solution Overview**:
	- The goal of this solution is to find the largest island (connected land area) in a given grid.
	- It does so by identifying individual land areas, calculating their sizes, and then considering adjacent 
	water cells to potentially merge areas.

2. **Key Components**:
	- `SolutionBase`:
		- Contains utility functions shared by the main solution.
		- `landSize(row, col)` recursively explores the grid starting from a given cell `(row, col)` and returns the 
		size of the connected land area.
		- It marks visited cells with an island ID (incremented from 2 onwards).
	- `Solution`:
		- Inherits from `SolutionBase`.
		- `get_areas(row, col)`:
			- Calls `landSize` to find the size of the land area starting from `(row, col)`.
			- Updates the maximum area (`m_max`) and stores the area in `m_IdAreaMap`.
		- `get_all_areas()`:
			- Iterates through the entire grid and calls `get_areas` for each land cell.
			- Initializes grid dimensions (`m_rows` and `m_cols`).
		- `largestIsland(grid)`:
			- Sets the grid (`m_matrix`) and computes all land areas using `get_all_areas()`.
			- Then iterates through water cells (value 0) to find adjacent islands and calculate their combined area.
			- Updates `m_max` with the largest area encountered.

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
	- For each land cell (value 1):
		- Explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) recursively using `landSize`.
		- Mark visited cells with an island ID.
		- Update the maximum area (`m_max`) and store the area in `m_IdAreaMap`.
	- For each water cell (value 0):
		- Check neighboring land cells.
		- Collect unique island IDs.
		- Calculate the combined area of adjacent islands.
		- Update `m_max` if a larger area is found.

4. **Overall Approach**:
	- Identify land areas and compute their sizes.
	- Consider water cells adjacent to land areas and merge their sizes.
	- Keep track of the largest area encountered.

Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or have additional questions! 😊

2. **Time Complexity**:
	- The `landSize` function recursively explores the grid to find the size of a land area starting from a given cell. It visits each cell at most once.
	- The `get_all_areas` function iterates through the entire grid and calls `get_areas` for each land cell.
	- The outer loop in `largestIsland` iterates through all cells in the grid.
	- The inner loop within the same function iterates through neighboring cells of water (value 0) and computes their combined area.
	- Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the grid size, which is O(rows * cols).

3. **Space Complexity**:
	- The space complexity mainly depends on the additional data structures used:
		- `m_matrix`: The grid itself, which requires O(rows * cols) space.
		- `m_IdAreaMap`: A map that stores the area of each island, which can be up to O(rows * cols) in total.
		- Recursive call stack in `landSize`: At most O(rows * cols) due to the recursion depth.
	- Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(rows * cols).
