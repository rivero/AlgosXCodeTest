* 
* Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes, p and q. 
If either node p or q does not exist in the tree, return null. 
All values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
"The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has 
both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)". 

A descendant of a node x is a node y that is on the path from node x to some leaf node.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5. A node can be a descendant of itself according to the definition of LCA.

Example 3:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10
Output: null
Explanation: Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
All Node.val are unique.
p != q

Solution

1. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The `lowestCommonAncestor` function aims to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, `p` and `q`, in a binary tree.
   - The algorithm follows these steps:
	 1. Define a helper function called `dfs` (depth-first search) that takes three parameters: 
	 the current `root`, and the target nodes `p` and `q`.
	 2. In the `dfs` function:
		- If the current `root` is null, return null.
		- Recursively call `dfs` on the left subtree (`root->left`) and the right subtree (`root->right`).
		- Check if the current `root` is equal to either `p` or `q`. If so:
		  - Update the corresponding flag (`p_found` or `q_found`) to indicate that the node has been found.
		  - Return the current `root`.
		- If both left and right subtrees (`l` and `r`) are not null, it means that `p` and `q` are found in different subtrees. In this case, the current `root` is the LCA.
		- Otherwise, return the non-null subtree (either `l` or `r`).
	 3. In the `lowestCommonAncestor` function:
		- Call `dfs` with the root of the tree and the target nodes `p` and `q`.
		- If both `p` and `q` are found (i.e., `p_found` and `q_found` are true), return the result of `dfs`.
		- Otherwise, return null.

2. **Complexities**:
   - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
	 - The algorithm traverses each node once during the depth-first search.
   - Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree.
	 - The space is used for the recursive call stack during the depth-first search.

3. **Example**:
   - Given a binary tree:
	 ```
		 3
		/ \
	   5   1
	  / \ / \
	 6  2 0  8
	   / \
	  7   4
	 ```
	 - Nodes 5 and 1 have LCA = 3.
	 - Nodes 5 and 4 have LCA = 5.
We use a DFS approach were we search for the values in both trees.
if we find the value in one tree and in other tree, three root is the LCA
if we find the value in one tree and not in the other, that node with the value is the LCA because nodes can be their own LCA.
	this is because one we know that the other three doesnt contain the value, we are guaranteed that the not found value
	will be a descendant of the found value so we return that one.
However, if either value is not found we return null
