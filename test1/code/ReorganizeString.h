* 767. Reorganize String

Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.



Example 1:

Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aba"
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaab"
Output: ""


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.

Hash Table
Heap (Priority Queue)

Approach
	Determine character frequencies using a hashmap.
	We now repeatedly select the most frequent character that isn't previously selected.
	This can be done efficiently using a priority queue.
	The character and it's frequency is stored in the priority queue using a pair.

Complexity
	Let N be the total characters in the string.
	Let k be the total unique characters in the string.

	Time complexity: The time complexity of this approach is O(N*logk) as we add one character to the result string 
	per operation and each priority queue operation costs logk.
	Space complexity: The maximum size of the priority queue is O(k) as there k distinct characters.
