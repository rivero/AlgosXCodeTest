	* 2268. Minimum Number of Keypresses

	You have a keypad with 9 buttons, numbered from 1 to 9, each mapped to lowercase English letters. 
	You can choose which characters each button is matched to as long as:

	All 26 lowercase English letters are mapped to.
	Each character is mapped to by exactly 1 button.
	Each button maps to at most 3 characters.
	To type the first character matched to a button, you press the button once. To type the second character, you press the button twice, and so on.

	Given a string s, return the minimum number of keypresses needed to type s using your keypad.

	Note that the characters mapped to by each button, and the order they are mapped in cannot be changed.



	Example 1:


	Input: s = "apple"
	Output: 5
	Explanation: One optimal way to setup your keypad is shown above.
	Type 'a' by pressing button 1 once.
	Type 'p' by pressing button 6 once.
	Type 'p' by pressing button 6 once.
	Type 'l' by pressing button 5 once.
	Type 'e' by pressing button 3 once.
	A total of 5 button presses are needed, so return 5.
	Example 2:


	Input: s = "abcdefghijkl"
	Output: 15
	Explanation: One optimal way to setup your keypad is shown above.
	The letters 'a' to 'i' can each be typed by pressing a button once.
	Type 'j' by pressing button 1 twice.
	Type 'k' by pressing button 2 twice.
	Type 'l' by pressing button 3 twice.
	A total of 15 button presses are needed, so return 15.


	Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 10^5
	s consists of lowercase English letters.

	Solution

	Build your keypad
		Map the letters (char, int) and divide the letter to nine keys
