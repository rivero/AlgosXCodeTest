	986. Interval List Intersections

	You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, 
	where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. 

	Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

	Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

	A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.

	The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that 
	are either empty or represented as a closed interval. 
	
	For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].

	Example 1:

	Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
	Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
	Example 2:

	Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
	Output: []


	Constraints:

	0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000
	firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1
	
	0 <= starti < endi <= 10^9
	endi < starti+1

	0 <= startj < endj <= 10^9
	endj < startj+1


	1. We have two input arrays, `A` and `B`, each containing intervals represented as pairs of integers: `[start, end]`.
	2. Initialize an empty result vector, `res`, to store the intersection intervals.
	3. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse the intervals in `A` and `B`, respectively.
	4. While both pointers are within bounds (i.e., `i < A.size()` and `j < B.size()`):
	   - Get the start and end points of the current intervals from `A` and `B`: `alow`, `ahigh`, `blow`, and `bhigh`.
	   - Calculate the intersection interval:
		 - The start of the intersection interval is the maximum of `alow` and `blow`: `lo = max(alow, blow)`.
		 - The end of the intersection interval is the minimum of `ahigh` and `bhigh`: `hi = min(ahigh, bhigh)`.
	   - If `lo <= hi`, there is a valid intersection, so add `{lo, hi}` to the result vector.
	   - Update the pointers:
		 - If `hi` equals `ahigh`, move the pointer in `A` to the next interval (`i++`).
		 - Otherwise, move the pointer in `B` to the next interval (`j++`).
	5. Return the resulting vector `res` containing the intersection intervals.

	This algorithm efficiently finds the overlapping intervals between `A` and `B`. 
	It leverages the fact that the intervals are sorted by their start points. 
	By comparing the start and end points, we can identify the intersection intervals without unnecessary checks. 
	The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N + M), where N and M are the sizes of arrays `A` and `B`, respectively. 😊
	
	The space complexity of this algorithm is indeed O(1) because it doesn't use any additional data structures that 
	grow with the input size. 
	Instead, it operates directly on the input arrays `A` and `B`, reusing the same variables for the intersection intervals. 
	Well spotted! 😊👍
