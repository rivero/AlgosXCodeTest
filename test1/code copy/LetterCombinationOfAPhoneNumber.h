Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. 
Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Constraints:

0 <= digits.length <= 4
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

## Algorithm Explanation

**Problem:** Given a string of digits, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. 
A mapping of digit to letters is given below:
```
2: abc
3: def
4: ghi
5: jkl
6: mno
7: pqrs
8: tuv
9: wxyz
```

**Approach:** Backtracking

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **`vector<string> combinations;`:** This vector will store all the generated letter combinations.
2. **`static string lettersNum(const string& digits)`:**
   - A helper function to map a digit to its corresponding letters.
   - Uses a static `phone_map` to store the digit-to-letter mapping.
   - Returns the letters corresponding to the first digit of the input `digits`.
3. **`void backtrack(const string& digits, const string& combination = "")`:**
   - Recursive function to generate letter combinations.
   - `digits`: The remaining digits to process.
   - `combination`: The current letter combination being built.
   - Base case: If `digits` is empty, add the current `combination` to `combinations`.
   - Recursive case:
	 - Get the letters corresponding to the first digit of `digits`.
	 - For each letter, recursively call `backtrack` with the remaining digits and the updated `combination`.
4. **`vector<string> letterCombinations(const string& digits)`:**
   - Public function to initiate the combination generation process.
   - Checks if `digits` is empty and returns an empty vector if so.
   - Calls `backtrack(digits)` to start the backtracking.
   - Returns the `combinations` vector containing all generated letter combinations.

	Let n be the length of the input digits.
	The total number of possible letter combinations is exponential (up to 4^n).
	TIME COMPLEXITY: Therefore, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(4^n) since we explore all possible combinations.
	SPACE COMPLEXITY: The space complexity is also O(4^n) because we store all valid combinations in the output vector.

	The algorithm effectively explores all possible letter combinations by recursively branching out for each digit. 
	The backtrack function builds combinations incrementally, adding one letter at a time. 
	The lettersNum function provides a mapping between digits and letters.

	Example:
	Breakdown for "23"
	1. Initial Call:

	letterCombinations("23") is called.
	An empty combinations vector is created.
	2. Backtracking:

	backtrack("23", "") is called.
	lettersNum("23") returns "ab".
	3. First Recursive Call:

	backtrack("3", "a") is called.
	lettersNum("3") returns "def".
	4. Second Level Backtracking:

	backtrack("", "ad") is called.
	digits is empty, so "ad" is added to combinations.
	backtrack("", "ae") is called.
	digits is empty, so "ae" is added to combinations.
	backtrack("", "af") is called.
	digits is empty, so "af" is added to combinations.
	5. First Recursive Call Backtracks:

	Returns to the previous level.
	6. Second Recursive Call:

	backtrack("3", "b") is called.
	Similar steps as above lead to "bd", "be", and "bf" being added to combinations.
	7. Final Result:

	The combinations vector now contains:
	"ad"
	"ae"
	"af"
	"bd"
	"be"
	"bf"
	Return Value:
	The function returns the combinations vector containing all possible letter combinations for "23".
