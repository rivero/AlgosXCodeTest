* 206. Reverse Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Input: head = []
Output: []
## Algorithm Explanation and Complexity

### Algorithm Explanation
The provided code reverses a singly linked list iteratively.

* **Three pointers:** `prev`, `curr`, and `next` are used to keep track of nodes during the reversal process.
* **Iterative process:**
	* `next` stores the next node to be processed.
	* The `next` pointer of the current node (`curr`) is reversed to point to the previous node (`prev`).
	* The `prev` and `curr` pointers are updated to move to the next node.
* **Return value:** The function returns the `prev` pointer, which becomes the new head of the reversed list.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the `reverseList` function is **O(n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is 
visited exactly once, and constant time operations are performed at each node.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of the `reverseList` function is **O(1)** as it uses a constant amount of extra space for the three pointers 
`prev`, `curr`, and `next`, regardless of the input size.

**In summary:** The provided code efficiently reverses a singly linked list in linear time and constant space.

## Tabular Example of Linked List Reversal

**Understanding the Problem:**
* We have a singly linked list.
* We want to reverse the order of the nodes in the list.

**Algorithm:**
* Use three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next`.
* Iterate through the list, reversing the links between nodes.

**Tabular Representation:**

| Iteration | prev					| curr					| next			   |
|---		|---					|---					|---			   |
| 1			| null					| 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 | 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 |
| 2			| 1						| 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5		| 3 -> 4 -> 5	   |
| 3			| 2						| 3 -> 4 -> 5			| 4 -> 5		   |
| 4			| 3						| 4 -> 5				| 5				   |
| 5			| 4						| 5						| null			   |
| 6			| 5						| null					| null			   |

**Explanation:**

* Initially, `prev` is null, `curr` points to the head of the list, and `next` points to the second node.
* In each iteration:
	* `next` stores the next node to be processed.
	* The `next` pointer of the current node (`curr`) is reversed to point to the previous node (`prev`).
	* The `prev` and `curr` pointers are updated for the next iteration.

**After the final iteration:**
* The `prev` pointer points to the last node, which becomes the new head of the reversed list.

**Visual Representation:**
```
Original: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Reversed: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

This table demonstrates how the pointers change during each iteration of the `reverse` function, resulting in a reversed linked list.
