	708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List
	
	Given a Circular Linked List node, which is sorted in non-descending order, 
	write a function to insert a value insertVal into the list such that it 
	remains a sorted circular list. 
	The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list and may not 
	necessarily be the smallest value in the circular list.

	If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, 
	you may choose any place to insert the new value. 

	After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.

	If the list is empty (i.e., the given node is null), 
	you should create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node. 
	
	Otherwise, you should return the originally given node.


	Example 1:

		1 -->|
		^    |
		|    |
		     |
		4<---3 head

	Input: head = [3,4,1], insertVal = 2
	Output: [3,4,1,2]
	Explanation: In the figure above, there is a sorted circular list of three elements. 
	You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list. 
	The new node should be inserted between node 1 and node 3. 
	After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return node 3.

		1 -->2
		^    |
		|    |
			 |
		4<---3 head


	Example 2:

	Input: head = [], insertVal = 1
	Output: [1]
	Explanation: The list is empty (given head is null). 
	We create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node.

	Example 3:

	Input: head = [1], insertVal = 0
	Output: [1,0]


	Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
	-10^6 <= Node.val, insertVal <= 10^6


	**The condition `curVal > nextVal && (curVal <= insertVal || insertVal <= nextVal)` checks for the end of a circularly linked 
	list and potential insertion points.**

	* **`curVal > nextVal`:** This part detects if we've reached the end of the list, where the last element points back to the 
	smallest element.
	* **`(curVal <= insertVal || insertVal <= nextVal)`:** This part checks if the current node and its next node enclose the new 
	value (for insertion in an ordered list).

	**Combined, the condition identifies either the end of the list or a suitable insertion point based on the value relationships.**



This algorithm maintains the sorted order of the circular linked list while inserting the new value. 
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the list, since we iterate through the entire list once. 
The space complexity is O(1) because we don't use any additional data structures. 😊👍
