There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) 
such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). 
For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, 
or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4


Certainly! Let's break down the algorithm and discuss its complexities:

1. **Algorithm Explanation**:
	- The given algorithm searches for a target value in a rotated sorted array (also known as a rotated array).
	- The array is sorted in ascending order, but it has been rotated at some pivot point.
	- The algorithm first finds the index of the minimum element (the pivot) using binary search.
	- Then, it determines which half of the array (left or right of the pivot) contains the target value.
	- Finally, it performs binary search again within the appropriate half to find the target.

2. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
	- **Finding the Pivot**:
		- The algorithm starts by finding the index of the minimum element (pivot) in the rotated array.
		- It uses binary search to locate the pivot index (`min_i`).
		- The pivot index divides the array into two sorted subarrays: `[0, min_i-1]` and `[min_i, n-1]`.
	- **Determining the Target Side**:
		- If `min_i` is 0, the entire array is sorted, and we search the entire array.
		- Otherwise, we compare the target with the first and last elements:
			- If `target` lies between `nums[0]` and `nums[min_i-1]`, we search the left side.
			- Otherwise, we search the right side.
	- **Binary Search for the Target**:
		- Within the chosen side, the algorithm performs binary search to find the target.
		- It adjusts the pointers (`l` and `r`) based on comparisons with `target`.

3. **Time Complexity**:
	- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log N), where N is the size of the input array.
	- The initial binary search to find the pivot takes O(log N) time.
	- The second binary search within the chosen side also takes O(log N) time.

4. **Space Complexity**:
	- The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses only a few variables (`l`, `r`, `m`, and `min_i`) 
	without any additional data structures.
